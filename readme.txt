== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Venmo Link Vs. Pay with Venmo =

The major difference between the two payment methods is that Venmo Link is a link to your Venmo @username (e.g venmo.com/username) while Pay with Venmo is the official integration by PayPal that needs to be set up with your PayPal account.
Notice that Pay with Venmo requires a PayPal business developer account while Venmo Link requires a Venmo account.

= Does this Venmo plugin integrate with the payment APIs? =

Yes, Venmo integrates the official Pay with Venmo end-to-end payment by PayPal since v4.0.

Also there is an extra payment method added that provides a quick and easy way to display to your customers your Venmo @username and to link them to it.
It only displays your Venmo @username to the customer and redirects them to it so that the off site Venmo transaction can take place.

Please check screenshots for more details on what is reported.

= Do I need a Venmo account or a PayPal business account to use this plugin? =

Yes, you need either a Venmo account or a PayPal business account. This plugin comes with 2 payment methods for Venmo. One requires a PayPal business account and the other requires a Venmo account.

= What is emailreceipts.io and do I need to integrate it? =

emailreceipts.io is a service that allows you to track Venmo payments and update order statuses automatically.
The integration also helps send automated emails to your customers when their order status changes.
If you do not want to use emailreceipts.io, you will have to manually update the order status in your Woocommerce admin dashboard.
